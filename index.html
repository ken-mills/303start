                    A foundation for creating an excellent company is an investment in people. Knowledge, skill, and
                    attitude are important competencies to develop and monitor. team303 does that but organizations
                    often forget to invest in and nurture the relationships between people, between supervisors and
                    employees, between executives and managers, or between coaches and players. The team303 design was based on
                    this core principle. team303 provides tools to develop strong, transparent, mentoring relationships
                    between people.

                    Organizations everywhere including many in the Fortune 500 have decided to trash their bureaucratic,
                    paper based, time sucking, performance managements systems. Why? Organizations are moving too fast.
                    These systems were designed for a different era. Many organizations are now simply asking their
                    managers and supervisors to meet with staff more frequently, communicate more, and create more time
                    for mentoring but with what tools? How does your CEO know that this is actually happening? team303
                    provides the toolbox to help supervisors engage with their team. team303 provides CEOs with a window
                    into how their employees are interacting light, fun, non-threatening way.

            <p >

            303start and team303 were created by me, Ken Mills. I am a software developer and former information technology executive.
            Organization's are struggling to find a performance management system that fit today's employees. Many organizations are using
            systems that were designed and developed many years ago for a different era. The culture and tools used by employees at work
            are vastly different yet the way many organizations engage and motivate employees has not changed.  I am suggesting that there is a better way.
            Through the team303 application and the information on this site, I hope to share what I have learned throughout my career as a
            manager. Some people write books. I write software.</p>

            <p>The ideas for team303 originated in 2009.  The hope was to create a
            more effective coaching resource for supervisors and managers. They need a system that provides time to
            working with staff and less time documenting. They need a resource ( a framework ) to guide them along the way. To build strong individual
            relationships, mentor and build great teams, they need simple way to document
            there conversations so executives have the information they need to grow their organizations.
            </p>

            <p>Where did 303 come from? 3:03 is when my friends and I tee off.</p>
